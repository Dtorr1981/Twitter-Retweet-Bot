This is a small php script which can be used to create twitter bots. I’ve used two files (twitteroauth.php and OAuth.php) of Abraham’s twitteroauth project to create this app. It works on OAuth, so no need to enter your twitter password.

To use this script upload all files onto your server, modify the query then call the file either from your web browser i.e www.yourdomain.com/twitter/twitterbot1.php or set it as a cron job. 

To check whether your retweet has worked navigate to retweet.php in your browser and this will show you your most recent tweet.
